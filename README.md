## Future plans

Implementation of a favorites list to track the scores of users favorite teams.
Addition of other E-sports games like League of Legends and CS go.

## Our motivation

We love games either playing or watching them. Seeing as E-sports is rising in popularity we thought it would be cool to have a leaderboard to see how teams ranked.

## What did it solve?

Its lets us and our users what teams are the best by the numbers rather than winning a lucky match or two.

## What did we learn?

Outside of the power of friendship we learned how to be a cohesive team. It also allowed us to sink our teeth into working with React and Vitae. It also sharpend our skills with CSS.

## How we stand out

We add an extra layer of competiveness for the fans of E-sports with leaderboards. Using these that we could even branch out to fantasty E-sports leagues.
